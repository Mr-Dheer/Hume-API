# Facial Emotion Recognition using HUME AI API

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the **HUME AI API** to perform **facial emotion recognition**. The goal is to analyze facial expressions and detect emotions in real-time or from uploaded images.

## Features
- **Real-time facial emotion detection** using webcam input.
- **Image-based emotion analysis** by uploading a photo.
- **Detailed emotion breakdown** with confidence scores.
- **Integration with HUME AI API** for accurate emotion recognition.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** for backend processing
- **HUME AI API** for facial emotion detection
- **OpenCV** for image and video processing
- **Streamlit** for the web-based interface
- **Requests** for API communication

## How It Works
1. **Capture or upload an image**.
2. **Send the image to HUME AI API** for analysis.
3. **Receive emotion predictions** along with confidence scores.
4. **Display results in a user-friendly format**.
